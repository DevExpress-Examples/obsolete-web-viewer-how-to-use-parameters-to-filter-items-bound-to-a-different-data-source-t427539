⛔ DEPRECATED. This example is unavailable starting with v19.1. **Web Dashboard Viewer** is not included in our installation packages and its API is removed from our source code. 

You can migrate to the [Web Dashboard Control](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/115955/) that allows you to create and display dashboards in the same application.
